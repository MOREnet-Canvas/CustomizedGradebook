# Customized Gradebook Documentation

This site documents how to configure and use the **Customized Gradebook (CG)** Canvas Theme tools.

## Start here
- [Admin Dashboard Overview](admin-dashboard.md)
- [Account Filtering](account-filtering.md)

## Key Concepts
- The theme must be installed at the **Root Account (ID: 1)** for student dashboard and `/grades` customizations to work.
- You can still restrict where CG runs using Account Filtering (sub-accounts).
