Good! Both files are already using formatGradeDisplay() from the shared utilities. The calculateDisplayValue() function I created is specifically for the dashboard card renderer's use case where it needs to handle different grade sources (assignment vs enrollment) and determine whether to show percentages or points.

Let me verify the current usage patterns and see if there are opportunities to use calculateDisplayValue():

After analyzing the code, I can see that:
allGradesPageCustomizer.js and gradePageCustomizer.js are already using formatGradeDisplay() from shared utilities ✅
cardRenderer.js is now using calculateDisplayValue() ✅
The display logic in allGradesPageCustomizer (lines 219-250) is actually business logic for determining whether a course should show points or percentages - this is different from the formatting logic and should stay where it is.
